  "body": "# PhotosExport #\r\n\r\nPhotosExport bulk exports your Photos.app data to any folder you choose, for easy backup, sharing or migration. While using iCloud Photo Library is fine, sometimes it's nice just to be able to export a folder full of photos & videos which is completely platform-agnostic, yet still respects the albums, folders and titles you've defined inside Photos.app.\r\n\r\nPhotosExport presents you with your albums in the same structure you see them in Photos.app, letting you choose which ones to export.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n> I used to use PhoShare to do this back in the iPhoto days, but not only was it a little fiddly and a bit long in the tooth, and didn't support Photos.app. I really liked being able to dump my photos & videos on a NAS for backup without needing all the Mac-specific metadata to support it, so I wrote a new tool which I can use in future.\r\n\r\n## NO WARRANTY ##\r\n\r\nThis is just something I hacked together in a few hours that I'm publishing for free. Use it at your own risk, and don't complain to me if it misbehaves.  I'll probably keep improving it since I need it myself, but I can't promise anything. I also can't promise that it won't have horrid bugs that lead to it filling up your hard drive or eloping with your significant other. \r\n\r\n## TODO ##\r\n\r\n* Sorting options (currently ordering is identical to Photos)\r\n* Add option: export originals (currently exports edited versions if present)\r\n* Add option: skip duplicates (photo in multiple albums) or symlink\r\n* Expose command line interface for scheduled running\r\n\r\n## Image Credits ##\r\n\r\n* Video Camera by Mike Arndt from the Noun Project\r\n* import by ChangHoon Baek from the Noun Project\r\n* Heart by Okan Benn from the Noun Project\r\n* Thunderbolt screen by Samy Menai from the Noun Project\r\n* timer by useiconic.com from the Noun Project\r\n* panorama by Francisca Ar√©valo from the Noun Project\r\n* Slideshow by Ralf Schmitzer from the Noun Project\r\n\r\n",
