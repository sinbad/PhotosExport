<p>PhotosExport bulk exports your Photos.app data to any folder you choose, for easy backup, sharing or migration.</p>

<p>While using iCloud Photo Library is fine, sometimes it's nice just to be able to export a folder full of photos &amp; videos which is completely platform-agnostic, yet still respects the albums, folders and titles you've defined inside Photos.app.</p>

<p>PhotosExport presents you with your albums in the same structure you see them in Photos.app, letting you choose which ones to export.</p>

<h2>Oh hey, that's like PhoShare right?</h2>
<p>Yep, I was a big user of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/phosharedoc/">PhoShare</a> to bulk export/back up my iPhoto data, but not only was it a little fiddly and a bit long in the tooth, it doesn't support Photos.app and has basically been abandoned. Personally I really like being able to dump my photos &amp; videos on a NAS for backup / posterity without it being dependent on the Mac-specific metadata, so I wrote a new tool.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>It behaves mostly as you'd expect (hopefully):
<ul>
  <li>Supports photos and videos</li>
  <li>Folders and album become directories</li>
  <li>Item titles are used as file names if supplied, if not the original file name is used</li>
  <li>Automatically detects duplication of file names during export &amp; appends _1, _2 etc to make unique</li>
  <li>Checks file sizes and modification times to avoid exporting content that already exists, so incremental exports work</li>
  <li>Remembers what you selected across restarts</li>
  <li>New albums not seen before are defaulted to being exported, system-generated ones like Faces, Slo-Mo are not</li>
  <li>Exports edited versions as a preference and originals otherwise</li>
  <li>Multi-select rows &amp; toggle with either mouse or Spacebar</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This is just something I hacked together in a few hours that I'm publishing for free. Use it at your own risk, and don't complain to me if it misbehaves.  I'll probably keep improving it since I need it myself, but I can't promise anything. I also can't promise that it won't have horrid bugs that lead to it filling up your hard drive or eloping with your significant other. </p>
