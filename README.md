# PhotosExport #

I used to use PhoShare to export data from iPhoto, and have been disappointed that there isn't an equivalent for Photos.app, which is now the standard in OS X 10.10+. So here's one I wrote to replace it.

It's simpler than PhoShare but a little more intuitive too since it reads your photo library on startup so you can choose which albums to export. It's still missing lots of features but currently will at least work. 

## NO WARRANTY ##

This is just something I hacked together in a few hours that I'm publishing for free. Use it at your own risk, and don't complain to me if it misbehaves.  I'll probably keep improving it since I need it myself, but I can't promise anything. I also can't promise that it won't have horrid bugs that lead to it filling up your hard drive or eloping with your significant other. 

## TODO ##

* Handle edge cases like Photos being edited during export more gracefully
* Sorting options (currently ordering is identical to Photos)
* Add option: export originals (currently exports edited versions if present)
* Add option: skip duplicates (photo in multiple albums) or symlink
* Expose command line interface for scheduled running
